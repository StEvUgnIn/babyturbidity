# üçºbabyturbidity

## Introduction
This repo is dedicated to the baby turbidity sensor. This sensor compromises on accuracy for low-cost. It was developed for a class on environmental sensing based on the Arduino framework.

## Code
The senseBox uses the Arduino framework so the Arduino library is a good place to start with example codes for [SD card usage](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/SD). Or the Adafruit library for the [ADC](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADS1X15). SenseBox also has example codes for each of their products. But I have also included the (very basic) code that we uploaded to this turbidity sensor.
